# Sum with the "S" of SOLID

## Repository dedicated to my organization of React classes that i teach to my students.

### App.jsx

Provides a single-page-application with a sum algorithm in a single function. Code is not very organizated and does not demonstrate the 'S' os SOLID.

### Solid.jsx

Provides the same single-page-application with the same sum algorithm, but now applying the single responsability principle of SOLID.
